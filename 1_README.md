## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

<<<<<<< HEAD
- Python 3.6+
- Necessary libraries listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   
   ```bash
   
   git clone https://github.com/mazimum86/LinearRegression.git
   cd linear-regression-project

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   
   '''bash
   
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   
3. Install the required dependencies:
 
  '''bash

   pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage
## Data Preprocessing
Scripts for data preprocessing can be found in the src/data_preprocessing.py file. Use these scripts to clean and prepare your data for modeling.

## Model Training
The `src/model_training.py` file contains scripts for training the linear regression model. You can modify the parameters and datasets as needed.

## Model Evaluation
Evaluate your model's performance using the scripts in src/model_evaluation.py. This includes metrics such as Mean Squared Error, R-squared, etc.

## Notebooks
Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory for detailed analysis and visualization:

* **exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb:** Data exploration and visualization.
* **linear_regression_model.ipynb**: Building and training the linear regression model.
* **model_evaluation.ipynb**: Evaluating the performance of the model.
## Running Tests
Ensure code reliability by running unit tests:

'''bash

pytest tests/
